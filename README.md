# ML100Days

## Description
Machine Learning 100 Days Programming Marathon is a programme held by Cupoy AI Learning Community, which is an online AI learning platform in Taiwan. The aim of the programme is to equip participants with the crucial knowledge in the field of machine learning and data science as well as the programming implementation ability. The programme contains topics such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, supervised learning, fine-tuning, unsupervised learning, deep learning and computer vision. The contents are divided into 107 individual daily tasks. Besides these daily tasks, there are one midterm and one final exam, wehere both are data challenges on Kaggle. The programme website is here https://www.cupoy.com/marathon/ml100.

## Midterm
The midterm data challenge focus on Enron fraud dataset. The goal is to identify whether an employee belongs to person of interest or not, given his/her financial data and communication records. Using several supervised learning models as well as blending ensemble, the best accuracy score I reach is around 0.77. I believe there are still a lot of improvements I can make, especially on feature engineering. The challenge can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2021-ml100marathon-midterm/overview/description.

## Final Exam
The final exam is about image recogition using deep learning. The dataset contains five flower species, incuding daisy, dandellion, rose, sunflower and tulip. In this case, I leverage pretrained ResNet-50 and simply modify the output NN layer, and further train the model to accomdate to the dataset. It obtains around 95% of accuracy after several epochs.
